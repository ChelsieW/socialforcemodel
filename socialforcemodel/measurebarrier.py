class MeasureBarrier(Obstacle):
    """ A barrier that counts the number of pedestrians that pass through it.

    The user can define a barrier by defining two points of the barrier. The
    way the barrier works is that it first requires the pedestrian to enter
    the barrier, then leave it in the same direction as it entered. This is to
    avoid pedestrians being counted multiple times due to stepping back and
    forth.

    Args:
        world: the world in which the barrier is placed
        start: first x,y point of barrier
        end: second x,y point of barrier
        direction: the direction in which pedestrians must pass through the
                   barrier to count. The following options are legal:
                   'up', 'left', 'down' or 'right'
